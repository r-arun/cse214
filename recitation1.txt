1. Write pseudo-code or a Java program to print all the elements in a linked 
list, from head to end, given the head node.

2. Given the head node of a linked list and a number 'i', give an algorithm to
find the ith element from the head of the linked list.

3. Given the head node of a linked list and a value v, give an algorithm to find
the first occurence of v in the linked list and give its 0-based index.
eg: Consider the linked list 5 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1. The first occurance of
1 is at position 1.
